3D Platforming game for 4770

For any new object that you wish to use as ground, give it the "Ground" layer and "Ground" Physics Material. This also applies for anything you want to be moveable on.

 Freeze XYZ rotation on moving objects, and also XYZ position on those you don't want to move at all from physics.
